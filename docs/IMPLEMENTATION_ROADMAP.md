## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

* Basic graph representation for neural architectures
* MCTS framework for discrete action spaces
* Quick training/evaluation pipeline for MNIST

## Phase 2: Core Model (Weeks 3-4)

* Graph transformer implementation
* Unified policy-value network
* Action masking and validity constraints

## Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 5-6)

* End-to-end training loop
* Baseline implementations (NEAT, random search)
* Basic experimentation and debugging

## Phase 4: Evaluation (Weeks 7-8)

* Comprehensive experiments
* Ablation studies
* Analysis and visualization
